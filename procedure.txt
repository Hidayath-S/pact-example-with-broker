v1. generate pact file via junit test
    - https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/tree/master/pact-jvm-consumer-junit
    - https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2017/03/consumer-driven-testing-pact-spring-boot.html
    - the spring-mvc consumer seems to be not maintained currently (no checkins)
    - just run "mvn clean install -DskipTests=false"
        - result is a json pact file in consumer/target/pacts

v2. producer should be verified with pact file (pact file is accessed via path)
    - https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2017/03/consumer-driven-testing-pact-spring-boot.html
    - https://github.com/DiUS/pact-workshop-jvm
    - https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/tree/master/pact-jvm-provider-junit
    - in order to manipulate the producer states, the testing is not done against a deployed WAR but in-memory via spring boot
    - could be done by database statements otherwise, or with CRUD calls on REST
    - so just "mvn clean install -DskipTests=false"
        - the pact files are specified via @PactFolder("/home/simon/dev/workspaces/java/pact-demo-parent/consumer/target/pacts")
        - examples for @State are given and how the service can be modified accordingly

3. use a pact broker. consumer uploads its file there, producer gets his pacts from there. use dockerized broker
    - https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker
    - configure e.g. authentication
    - use docker-compose for example, cd pact-broker && docker-compose up -d
    - mvn pact:publish
    - go to localhost:80

4. try states. in the producer tests some methods must be annotated with @State. there inject DAOs or so to manipulate
   the producer state accordingly.
    - start the producer tests to see, that the producer fulfills all client contracts
    - currently the pact broker infos are defined in the tests itself, so that they can also be started by the IDE itself
    - otherwise, the pact files must be fetched from the broker before the tests start, e.g. by the maven plugin?
        - https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/tree/master/pact-jvm-provider-maven
    - or the maven pact plugin must perform the verification itself somehow??
    - anyway, start the tests by IDE or mvn clean install -DskipTests=false
